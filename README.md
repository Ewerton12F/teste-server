# Hello

This is the basis of a Django+Postgres+Next.js private project. You can use for building you own app. Give a look above for more details.

## Railway + Vercel

I deployed the Django+Postgres on a Railway server. You can access the API [here][railway].

I deployed the Next.js website on a Vercel server. You can access [here][vercel]. The Github repository can be found [here][next-repo].

## Get Started

First things comes first, download the repository to your machine and enter the folder:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ewerton12F/teste-server.git
cd teste-server
```

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now you have to install the the dependencies in `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Configuring environment variables

We're gona use environment variables to set up our Django project.

Now that we have done the Run step we must configure the environment variables. Those are:

```bash
DEBUG=DEBUG
HOST=HOST
SECRET_KEY=SECRET_KEY
DATABASE_URL=DATABASE_URL
```

You can use the example file [`.env_example`](.env_example) in the root and change the variables values. Don't forget to rename the file to `.env`.

We're gona use `dotenv` and `decouple` package to manage our environment variables.

In `base.py` file I will set this configuration:

```python
from decouple import config
from dotenv import load_dotenv

import os

load_dotenv()

env = os.environ.get

DEBUG = config("DEBUG", default=False, cast=bool)
HOST = env("HOST")
SECRET_KEY = env("SECRET_KEY")
DATABASE_URL = env("DATABASE_URL")
```

* In `DEBUG` we must set the variable to `True` if we're working locally - it's gona trigger some features to help on debuging. To production we must set it to `False`. 
* The `HOST` can set to `127.0.0.1` if we're working locally. To production we must set it to `changethisdomain.com`.
* The `DATABASE_URL` must follow this patern `postgresql://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}:{PORT}/{NAME}`.
* Use some tool to generate your own `SECRET_KEY`, like the one above here.

### Secret key generation

We are gona add our own secret key. Python brings a built-in tool which enables us to generate a secret key.

In [Django Github repository][django-repo] we can find a function that`s going to provide a way of generating a random key.

To create a secret key we need to access the python shell using the command:

```bash
$ python3 manage.py shell
```

And then:

```bash
$ from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
$ print(get_random_secret_key())
```

And we're a gona get something like this:

```bash
0v7#=qc!&0^yhqyzc2)atop#at_foelv6g4*6=)if#r=@5=6mb
```
### Run

That's it, we're finish the setup and now we can run some Django commands:

```bash
./manage.py migrate api
./manage.py migrate 
```

Now we can finally make our Django project run:

```bash
./manage.py runserver
```

## Django

In this section I'm going to describe how I setup this Django application.

### Configuring Multiple Settings Files

The settings will be divided in other files because this application will be runing in ours machines and a server when deployed.

We have different environments with different configurations so we have to be prepared for that.

We can create a modular approuch and have different settings files for different environments for our Django application to work within. For example, we can use `DEBUG = True` when we work locally.

So we want to tell Django to find settings as shows:

```bash
.
├── settings
│   ├── base.py
│   ├── local.py
│   └── production.py.py 
.
```

In `manage.py` we determinate which configuration will be used for each environment:

```python
from core.settings import base

def main():
    if base.DEBUG:
        os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "core.settings.local")
    else:
        os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "core.settings.production")
```

In `core.urls` we determine which configuration use for each environment.

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += [
        path("__debug__/", include("debug_toolbar.urls")),
    ] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

### `local.py`

Settings related to local development

### `production.py`

Settings related to deployed application

### WSGI

#### Gunicorn

## Django Rest Framework

### Routers

Implement Routers

### Serializers

Implement serializer custumizations to customize data output

### API endpoints

Document the API endpoints to support frontend interactions 


The back-end is developed using Django Rest Framework to provide an API which will be consumed by the Next.JS front-end application.


## Tests

@ Phase 4 - Buid unit and end-to-end tests to ensure the application works as intended

- pytest
- pytest_django

---

Set static root settings - If using Django, Heroku will automatically generate your static files for you, so be sure to set the static root using STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'staticfiles').
Use psycopg2-binary for Postgres support - Add Postgres support to your application using the psycopg2-binary package. Be sure to pin it to the latest version (2.7.6.1 or higher).
Use dj-database-url to set database URL - Import parse from dj_database_url and pass your Heroku database URL directly to your database settings without hard coding the URL.
Use the whitenoise package to serve static assets - Avoid the need to rely on Nginx and allow your WSGI Python app to serve its own static files using the whitenoise package. It also works great behind a CDN.

# Design

If you access the link above you'll see that it's a mobile version of the layout 
below. This happened because in the middle of the development I understood the
concept of "Mobile First". 

I'm using Figma to design the layout of this website.
